## My process

I began by analyzing the design and setting up the project structure. I then wrote the HTML to structure the content semantically, followed by CSS to style the component and center it on the page, I wrote the media query to adapt to the specified screen size of 375px. Finally, I refined the layout to match the design as closely as possible both on the desktop and mobile view.

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

-   Learnt more about the HTML structure
-   Learnt more about the box model.
-   Learnt more about flexbox.

### Continued development

-   Iâ€™d like to continue learning how to write clean, semantic HTML that improves accessibility and structure.
-   I want to continue improving my ability to create fully responsive components that adapt well to various screen sizes using CSS media queries and flexible layout techniques.
-   I want to sharpen my eye for design precision, focusing on replicating layouts as closely as possible to improve attention to detail.
